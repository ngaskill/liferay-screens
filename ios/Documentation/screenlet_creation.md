# Creating Screenlets in Liferay Screens for iOS

## Important Note

*This product is under heavy development and its features aren't ready for use in production. It's being made public only to allow developers to preview the technology*.

## Introduction

This document explains the steps required to create your own screenlet. Before proceeding, you may want to read the [Architecture Guide](architecture.md) in order to understand the underlying concepts. You may also want to read the guide [How to Create Your Own Theme](theme_creation.md) in order to support the new screenlet from the Default or other themes.

The steps below walk you through creating an example screenlet for bookmarks that has the following features:

- Allows entry of a URL in a text box.
- Checks if the URL is valid and extract its title value. 
- Allows the user to modify the title.
- Upon user confirmation, the URL and title is sent back to the Liferay instance's Bookmark services to be saved.

This project [in this folder](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/ios/Samples/AddBookmark-screenlet) contains the screenlet described in this tutorial. You can use it as a reference.

## Steps

* Create a new `xib` called `AddBookmarkView_default.xib`. You'll build your UI here using Interface Builder. Put in two text box fields (`UITextField`) for the URL and title. Also, add a couple of buttons to let the user retrieve the title and save the bookmark. To differentiate between these two user actions, assign a value for the `restorationIdentifier` property in each button (for example `get-title` and `add-bookmark`)

    ![The new `xib` file for the new screenlet.](Images/xcode-add-bookmark.png)

* Create a new protocol called `AddBookmarkViewModel`. The associated attributes are `URL` and `title`.

```swift
@objc protocol AddBookmarkViewModel {

	var URL: String? {get set}

	var title: String? {get set}

}
```

* Create a new class called `AddBookmarkView_default` that extends `BaseScreenletView` and conforms `AddBookmarkViewModel`. It must wire all UI components and events from the `xib` using the standard `@IBOutlet` and `@IBAction`. Getters and setters from `AddBookmarkViewModel` should, respectively, get and set the data from UI components. Also be sure to write any animations or front end code here.

```swift 
import UIKit
import LiferayScreens

class AddBookmarkView_default: BaseScreenletView, AddBookmarkViewModel {

	@IBOutlet weak var URLTextField: UITextField!
	@IBOutlet weak var titleTextField: UITextField!

	var URL: String? {
		get {
			return URLTextField.text
		}
		set {
			URLTextField.text = newValue
		}
	}

	var title: String? {
		get {
			return titleTextField.text
		}
		set {
			titleTextField.text = newValue
		}
	}

}
```

* Set `AddBookmarkView_default` as the custom class of your `AddBookmarkView_default.xib` file. If you're using CocoaPods, be careful to set the appropiate module (don't use the grayed value "Current"). For example, the Custom Class setting in this screenshot is incorrect. This is because the `xib` file is bound to the custom class name without specifying the module:

![The `xib` file is bound to the custom class name without specifying the module.](Images/xcode-theme-custom-module-wrong.png)

In the following screenshot, the setting for the custom class is correct:

![Xib file binded to custom class name specifying the module.](Images/xcode-theme-custom-module-right.png)

* Create a class called `GetSiteTitleInteractor` that extends from class `Interactor`. This will be the place where we're going to write the code to get the title of the web site. It's important to understand how an interactor works:
	* It works asynchronously. This means that the underlaying operation (to retrieve the HTML page) will be run in background and when it's completed, a closure will be called: `onSuccess` or `onFailure` depending on the result of the operation. You have to use `callOnSuccess()` and `callOnFailure(error)` methods to invoke those closures. 
	* You have to override the method `start()` and place your code there.
	* Since the interactor receives the source screenlet in the init method, you can use that reference to read input data.

```swift
import UIKit
import LiferayScreens

public class GetSiteTitleInteractor: Interactor {

	public var resultTitle: String?

	override public func start() -> Bool {
		let viewModel = self.screenlet as! AddBookmarkViewModel

		if let URL = viewModel.URL {
			// 1. use NSURLSession to retrieve the HTML
			// 2. When the response arrives, extract the title from the HTML
			// 3. Save the extracted title in the property 'resultTitle'
			// 4. invoke callOnSuccess() or callOnFailure(error) when everything is done

			// return true to notify the operation is in progress
			return true
		}

		// return false if you cannot start the operation
		return false
	}
   
}
```

* Now, do the same with the second interactor: `LiferayAddBookmarkInteractor`. This will be responsible for sending the URL and title to the Liferay portal to be stored there. We use `Liferay` as class name prefix to denote the interactor will use Liferay's services.

```swift
import UIKit
import LiferayScreens

public class LiferayAddBookmarkInteractor: Interactor {

	public var resultBookmarkInfo: [String:AnyObject]?

	override public func start() -> Bool {
		let viewModel = self.screenlet as! AddBookmarkViewModel

		if let URL = viewModel.URL {
			// 1. use MobileSDK's services to send the bookmark to the portal
			// 3. Save the response in the property 'resultBookmarkInfo'
			// 4. invoke callOnSuccess() or callOnFailure(error) when everything is done

			// return true to notify the operation is in progress
			return true
		}

		// return false if you cannot start the operation
		return false
	}
   
}
```

* Now it's time to glue everything together. Let's create a class called `AddBookmarkScreenlet ` that extends `BaseScreenlet`.

* Optionally, you can add any `@IBInspectable` property to configure the behavior. For example, you could use a boolean property to configure whether the user can save broken URLs.

```swift
import UIKit
import LiferayScreens

class AddBookmarkScreenlet: BaseScreenlet {


}
```

* Override the `createInteractor` method so you return an instance of your interactor depending on the parameter `name`: `GetSiteTitleInteractor` for name `get-title` and `LiferayAddBookmarkInteractor` for name `add-bookmark`. Let's call separated methods for create each interactor:

```swift
override public func createInteractor(#name: String?, sender: AnyObject?) -> Interactor? {
	switch name! {
	case "get-title":
		return createGetTitleInteractor()

	case "add-bookmark":
		return createAddBookmarkInteractor()

	default:
		return nil
	}
}
```

* The method to create the `GetSiteTitleInteractor` should looks like the following:

```swift
private func createGetTitleInteractor() -> GetSiteTitleInteractor {
	let interactor = GetSiteTitleInteractor(screenlet: self)

	// this shows the standard activity indicator in the screen...
	self.showHUDWithMessage("Getting site title...", details: nil)

	interactor.onSuccess = {
		self.hideHUD()

		// when the interactor is finished, set the resulting title in the title text field
		(self.screenletView as? AddBookmarkViewModel)?.title = interactor.resultTitle
	}

	interactor.onFailure = { err in
		self.showHUDWithMessage("An error occurred retrieving the title",
				details: nil,
				closeMode: .ManualClose(true),
				spinnerMode: .NoSpinner)
	}

	return interactor
}
```

* And the method to create the `LiferayAddBookmarkInteractor` should looks like the following:

```swift
private func createAddBookmarkInteractor() -> LiferayAddBookmarkInteractor {
	let interactor = LiferayAddBookmarkInteractor(screenlet: self)

	self.showHUDWithMessage("Saving bookmark...", details: nil)

	interactor.onSuccess = {
		self.hideHUDWithMessage("Bookmark saved!")
	}

	interactor.onFailure = { e in
		self.showHUDWithMessage("An error occurred saving the bookmark",
				details: nil,
				closeMode: .ManualClose(true),
				spinnerMode: .NoSpinner)
	}

	return interactor
}
```

* You're done! Now you can add your new screenlet to your storyboard as usual and use it as a ready-to-use component. When the user presses any button, the BaseScreenlet's code will create and run the interactor.

* If you want to see the final code, you have the project with this screenlet in [this folder](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/ios/Samples/AddBookmark-screenlet).
