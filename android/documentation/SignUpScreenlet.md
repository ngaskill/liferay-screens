# SignUpScreenlet for Android

## Important Note

*This product is under heavy development and its features aren't ready for use in production. It's being made public only to allow developers to preview the technology.*

## Requirements

- Android SDK 4.0 (API Level 14) and above
- Liferay Portal 6.2 CE or EE
- Mobile Widgets plugin

## Compatibility

- Android SDK 4.0 (API Level 14) and above

## Features

The main function of the `SignUpScreenlet` is to create a new user in your Liferay instance. For example, by using `SignUpScreenlet` a new user of your app can become a new user in your portal. You can also use this screenlet to save the new user's credentials on their device. This enables auto login for future sessions. The screenlet also supports navigation of form fields from the keyboard of the user's device.

## Module

For more details, refer to the [Configuring Portal Settings](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/configuring-portal-settings) section of the User Guide.

## Anonymous Requests

Anonymous requests can be done without the user being logged in. However, authentication is still required to call the API. To allow this operation, it's recommended that the portal administrator create a specific user with minimal permissions. To use `SignUpScreenlet`, you need to use that user in your layout (we recommend adding the credentials to `server_context.xml`).

## Required Attributes

- `layoutId`
- `anonymousApiUserName`
- `anonymousApiPassword`

## Attributes

| Attribute | Data type | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------| 
| `layoutId` | `@layout` | The layout used to show the view.|
| `anonymousApiUserName` | `string` | The user's name, email address, or ID to use for authenticating the request. Which of these is used depends on the portal's authentication method. |
| `anoymousApiPassword` | `string` | The password to authenticate the request with. |
| `companyId` | `number` | When set, a user in the specified company is authenticated. If set to `0`, the company specified in `LiferayServerContext` is used. |
| `autoLogin` | `boolean` | Sets whether the user is logged in automatically after a successful sign up. |
| `credentialsStore` | `enum` | Sets the mode for storing user credentials. The posible values are `none`, `auto`, and `shared_preferences`. If set to `shared_preferences`, the user credentials and attributes are stored using Android's `SharedPreferences` class. If set to `none`, user credentials and attributes aren't saved at all. If set to `auto`, the best of the available storage modes is used. Currently, this is equivalent to `shared_preferences`. The default value is `none`. |

## Listener

The `LoginScreenlet` delegates some events to an object that implements the `LoginListener` interface. This interface lets you implement the following methods:

| Method | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------| 
|  <pre>onSignUpSuccess(User user)</pre> | Called when sign up successfully completes. The `user` parameter contains a set of the created user's attributes. The supported keys are the same as those in the [portal's User entity](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.x/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/service.xml#L2227) |
|  <pre>onSignUpFailure(Exception e)</pre> | Called when an error occurs in the process. |
