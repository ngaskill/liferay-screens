## Portal Configuration

No additional steps required.

## Activity Configuration

The `UserPortraitScreenlet` needs the following user permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

Both are used by the `editable` property to take a picture with the phone's camera and store it locally before uploading it to the portal. The activity using `UserPortraitScreenlet` also needs to override the `onActivityResult` method to send the picture information to the screenlet. Here's an example implementation:

```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
	super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
	
	if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
		_userPortraitScreenlet.upload(requestCode, data);
	}
}
```

## Required Attributes

- `layoutId`

## Attributes

| Attribute | Data type | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------| 
| `layoutId` | `@layout` | The layout used to show the view. |
| `autoLoad` | `boolean` | Whether the portrait should load when the screenlet is attached to the window. |
| `userId` | `number` | The ID of the user whose portrait is being requested. If this attribute is set, the `male`, `portraitId`, and `uuid` attributes are ignored. |
| `male` | `boolean` | Whether the default portrait placeholder shows a male or female outline. This attribute is used if `userId` isn't specified. |
| `portraitId` | `number` | The ID of the portrait to load. This attribute is used if `userId` isn't specified. |
| `uuid` | `string` | The `uuid` of the user whose portrait is being requested. This attribute is used if `userId` isn't specified. |
| `editable` | `boolean` | Lets the user change the portrait image by taking a photo or selecting a gallery picture. |

## Methods

| Method | Return | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------| 
| `load()` | `void` | Starts the request to load the user specified in the `userId` property, or the portrait specified in the `portraitId`and `uuid` properties. |
| `upload(int requestCode,`<br/>`Intent onActivityResultData)` | `void` | Starts the request to upload a profile picture from the source specified in the `requestCode` property (gallery or camera), and with the path stored in the `onActivityResultData` variable. |

## Listener

The `UserPortraitScreenlet` delegates some events to an object that implements the `UserPortraitListener` interface. This interface lets you implement the following methods:

| Method | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------| 
|  <pre>onUserPortraitReceived(<br/>        UserPortraitScreenlet source, <br/>        Bitmap bitmap)</pre> | Called when an image is received from the server. You can then apply image filters (grayscale, for example) and return the new image. You can return `null` or the original image supplied as the argument if you don't want to modify it. |
|  <pre>onUserPortraitFailure(<br/>        UserPortraitScreenlet source, <br/>        Exception e)</pre> | Called when an error occurs in the process. |
|  <pre> onUserPortraitUploaded(<br/>        UserPortraitScreenlet source)</pre> | Called when the user portrait upload service finishes. |
|  <pre> onUserPortraitUploadFailure(<br/>        UserPortraitScreenlet source, <br/>        Exception e)</pre> | Called when an error occurs uploading the user portrait. |
