## Portal Configuration

DDLs and Data Types should be properly configured in the portal before using `DDLListScreenlet`. For more details, see the Liferay User Guide sections [Defining Data Types](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/building-a-list-platform-in-liferay-and-defining-data-) and [Creating Data Lists](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/creating-data-lists).

## Required Attributes

- `layoutId`
- `recordSetId`
- `labelFields`

## Attributes

| Attribute | Data type | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------| 
| `layoutId` | `@layout` | The layout to use to show the view. |
| `autoLoad` | `boolean` | Whether the list should be loaded when it's presented on the screen. The default value is `true`. |
| `firstPageSize` | `number` | The number of items to retrieve from the server for display on the first page. The default value is `50`. |
| `pageSize` | `number` | The number of items to retrieve from the server for display on the second and subsequent pages. The default value is `25`. |
| `recordSetId` | `number` | The ID of the DDL being called. To find your DDLs' IDs, click *Admin* &rarr; *Content* from the Dockbar. Then click *Dynamic Data Lists* on the left. Each DDL's ID is in the ID column of the table. |
| `userId` | `number` | The ID of the user to filter records on. Records aren't filtered if the `userId` is `0`. The default value is `0`. |
| `labelFields` | `string` | The comma separated names of the DDL fields to show. Refer to the list's data definition to find the field names. To do so, click *Admin* &rarr; *Content* from the Dockbar. Then click *Dynamic Data Lists* on the left and click the *Manage Data Definitions* button. You can view the fields by clicking on any of the data definitions in the table. Note that the appearance of these values depends on the `layoutId` set. |

## Methods

| Method | Return | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------| 
| `loadPage(pageNumber)` | `void` | Starts the request to load the specified page of records. The page is shown when the response is received. |

## Listener

The `DDLListScreenlet` delegates some events to an object that implements the `DDLListListener` interface. This interface extends from `BaseListListener` and lets you implement the following methods:

| Method | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------| 
|  <pre>onListPageReceived(<br/>      BaseListScreenlet source, <br/>      int page,<br/>      List<DDLEntry> entries,<br/>      int rowCount)</pre> | Called when a page of records is received. Note that this method may be called more than once; once for each page received.|
|  <pre>onListPageFailed(<br/>      BaseListScreenlet source, <br/>      int page,<br/>      Exception e)</pre> | Called when an error occurs in the process. |
|  <pre>onListItemSelected(<br/>      BaseListScreenlet source, <br/>      DDLEntry entry)</pre> | Called when an item in the list is selected. |
